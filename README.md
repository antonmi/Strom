# Strom

## Stream Processing Framework

Strom is built on top of [ALF](https://github.com/antonmi/ALF).

Strom adds several abstractions:
- Source and Sink for reading/writing data from/to external sources
- Mixer and Splitter for mixing/splitting streams
- Topology

More will follow.

For now, check the [parcels_test.exs](https://github.com/antonmi/Strom/blob/main/test/examples/parcels/parcels_test.exs)

DSL will like there [dsl_test.exs](https://github.com/antonmi/Strom/blob/main/test/dsl_test.exs)
